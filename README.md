## Notes

Please note that the on-line data does not seem to match the description of its source.
In particular, there are clear problems in terms of concepts, such as mismatch in
numbers and glosses partially overlapping, likely translated from Swahili to
English. A serious problem is the fact that there does not seem to be a full
correspondence between English glosses and single concepts, i.e., in some cases
it seems that the same English gloss is used to two or more different concepts. The help
of someone versed in Tanzanian languages, or at least in Swahili, is probabily needed
to improve the quality of this data.
